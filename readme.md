# SolBond

> Store, share & sell digital things

## ðŸ–¤

Current first designs and how product works are greatly inspired by [Polar.sh](https://github.com/polarsource/polar)

We plan to drift away from it in consequential way as we cover the use cases of buying/selling products well together with SDK.

i.e. you can imagine SolBond as Polar.sh clone that also has crypto included but also is a hub for organizations to move faster.
